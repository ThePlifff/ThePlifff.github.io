		<h1 class="abtme">About ME</h1>
		<p class="para-abt1">My name is Brandon Samaroo and I am an aspiring Graphics Designer. My Designer Company is called ThePlifff Designs.</p>
		<p class="para-abt2">My love for Graphics Designing started a few years back, where i was introduced to a software called Cinema4D by a friend. From that moment I my interest in Graphics Designing have been up and down, since the software was quite difficult to understand. But after a few months of practice and tutorials I was able to grasp the basics and created some very basic 3D models. And from that moment on I continued to practice. I can't guarantee that my work is as good as those professionals out there but eventually I will be up to there standards. I also have some experience with music and animation. </p>
